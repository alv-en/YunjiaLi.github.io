      <section>
        <p>I'm a data professional with a Masters degree in economics. That means I enjoy tinkering around with code, but also love to see real-world impact of my work.</p>
        <p>For example, I built <a href="#">this</a>, <a href="#">this</a>, and <a href="#">this</a>. </p>

      <section>
        <p>A self-taught programmer, I love learning anything about data and software engineering. </p>
        <p>In my limited free time, I am reading about math, running, and get lost in nature.</p>
